# Calculator

Submission for The Odin Project, Project: Calculator

Created a calculator with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition to clicking, keyboard input works too.

Added changing signs, a deep clear, and square root functionality to get an even grid of buttons.

Finally, to really get the true feel, used the classic calculator text for the output. (Source: https://www.fontspace.com/category/calculator)
